<b>OWASP Top Ten (2021):</b><br/><br/>

üîì <b>1. Broken Access Control</b><br/>
Access restrictions are not enforced properly, allowing attackers to act as users or admins.<br/><br/>

üîê <b>2. Cryptographic Failures</b><br/>
Sensitive data is exposed due to weak or missing encryption and improper key management.<br/><br/>

üíâ <b>3. Injection</b><br/>
Untrusted input is sent to an interpreter (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, OS), leading to code execution.<br/><br/>

üõ†Ô∏è <b>4. Insecure Design</b><br/>
Flawed application architecture or logic that fails to anticipate abuse cases.<br/><br/>

‚öôÔ∏è <b>5. Security Misconfiguration</b><br/>
Improper configuration of servers, frameworks, or permissions can expose vulnerabilities.<br/><br/>

üì¶ <b>6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components</b><br/>
Using old libraries or software that have known security issues.<br/><br/>

üßë‚Äçüíª <b>7. Identification & Authentication Failures</b><br/>
Poor implementation of authentication mechanisms leads to unauthorized access.<br/><br/>

üß™ <b>8. Software & Data Integrity Failures</b><br/>
Lack of integrity checks on software updates or CI/CD pipelines can allow tampering.<br/><br/>

üìâ <b>9. Security Logging & Monitoring Failures</b><br/>
Insufficient logging and alerting delays threat detection and response.<br/><br/>

üåê <b>10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)</b><br/>
SSRF flaws allow attackers to make internal server requests from an untrusted source.<br/>

    <string name="common_cyber_threats">Common Cyber Threats</string>

    <string name="threats_content"><![CDATA[
<b>1. Phishing Attacks:</b><br>
- Cybercriminals send fake emails or messages to trick you into revealing sensitive information.<br>
- Example: A fake email claiming to be from your bank asking for your login credentials.<br>
- Prevention: Be cautious of unsolicited emails, check for spelling errors, and don‚Äôt click on suspicious links.<br><br>

<b>2. Malware:</b><br>
- Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to your device.<br>
- Types: Viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware.<br>
- Prevention: Install antivirus software and avoid downloading files from untrusted sources.<br><br>

<b>3. Ransomware:</b><br>
- A type of malware that encrypts your files and demands payment for their release.<br>
- Prevention: Regularly back up your data and avoid clicking on suspicious links.<br><br>

<b>4. Social Engineering:</b><br>
- Attackers manipulate you into divulging confidential information.<br>
- Example: Pretending to be a tech support agent and asking for your password.<br>
- Prevention: Be suspicious of unsolicited requests for sensitive information and verify identities.<br><br>

<b>5. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:</b><br>
- Attackers intercept communication between two parties to steal data.<br>
- Prevention: Use encrypted connections (HTTPS) and avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions.<br><br>

<b>6. Password Attacks:</b><br>
- Attackers use brute force or dictionary attacks to guess your password.<br>
- Prevention: Use strong, unique passwords and enable 2FA.<br><br>

<b>7. IoT Vulnerabilities:</b><br>
- Internet of Things (IoT) devices often have weak security, making them easy targets.<br>
- Prevention: Change default passwords, keep firmware updated, and secure your IoT devices with encryption.<br><br>

<b>8. DDoS Attacks:</b><br>
- Distributed Denial of Service attacks aim to overwhelm systems and make them unavailable.<br>
- Prevention: Implement firewalls and traffic monitoring systems to detect and mitigate attacks.<br><br>

<b>9. SQL Injection:</b><br>
- Attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate or extract data from a database.<br>
- Prevention: Use parameterized queries and sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection.<br><br>

<b>10. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</b><br>
- A vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.<br>
- Prevention: Sanitize user input, escape output, and implement Content Security Policy (CSP).<br><br>

<b>11. Insider Threats:</b><br>
- When employees or trusted individuals misuse their access to systems or information for malicious purposes.<br>
- Prevention: Implement strict access controls, monitor user activity, and educate employees on security practices.<br><br>

<b>12. Zero-Day Exploits:</b><br>
- Attacks targeting previously unknown vulnerabilities in software or hardware.<br>
- Prevention: Regularly update and patch software and systems to protect against zero-day vulnerabilities.

    <string name="tips_content"><![CDATA[
<b>1. Use Strong Passwords:</b><br>
- Create passwords with at least 12 characters, including numbers, symbols, and uppercase/lowercase letters.<br>
- Avoid using common words or personal information.<br><br>

<b>2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</b><br>
- Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by enabling 2FA.<br>
- Use an authenticator app or SMS-based verification.<br><br>

<b>3. Keep Software Updated:</b><br>
- Regularly update your operating system, apps, and antivirus software to patch vulnerabilities.<br><br>

<b>4. Be Cautious of Phishing Emails:</b><br>
- Do not click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders.<br>
- Verify the sender‚Äôs email address before responding.<br><br>

<b>5. Use a VPN on Public Wi-Fi:</b><br>
- Avoid accessing sensitive information on public Wi-Fi networks.<br>
- Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic.<br><br>

<b>6. Backup Your Data:</b><br>
- Regularly back up important files to an external drive or cloud storage.<br>
- Ensure backups are encrypted and secure.<br><br>

<b>7. Monitor Your Accounts:</b><br>
- Regularly check your bank and online accounts for unauthorized transactions.<br>
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity.<br><br>

<b>8. Enable Security Features on Your Devices:</b><br>
- Use features like "Find My Device" and biometric authentication for added protection.<br><br>

<b>9. Use Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software:</b><br>
- Install and regularly update antivirus software to detect and block malware.<br><br>

<b>10. Be Cautious with Personal Information:</b><br>
- Avoid oversharing on social media and protect your personal data from being exposed.<br><br>

<b>11. Encrypt Sensitive Data:</b><br>

<b>12. Educate Yourself and Others:</b><br>
- Stay informed about new threats and educate those around you to improve overall security.<br><br>

<b>13. Verify URLs:</b><br>
